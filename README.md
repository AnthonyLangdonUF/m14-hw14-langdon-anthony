## Hello!
# I used several Bootstrap components in this project, including a card, a button, a dropdown menu, and a badge. 
# In terms of difficuly, I initially struggled to find a way to change the color without adding a css file, but eventually found a helpful page on W3. The Bootstrap website did not provide as much assistance in that regard.
